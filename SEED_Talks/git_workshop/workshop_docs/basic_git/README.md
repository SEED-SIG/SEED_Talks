# Basic Git

Welcome to the basic git section of the workshop, you should read the rest of the section below before moving onto the rest of the sections.  
(Think of it as an index section, -_-, I'm not laughing)  

## Some prerequisites

You can think of these as checkmarks/things you should know or atleast be familiar with before starting this section.  

1. Basic bash
   * This is important as you will mainly be using the bash shell to run git commands as well as other basic files and folders commands.
2. Having git installed
    * This is a no-brainer
3. Setting up your basic configs in git
    * This is referring to your default editor and git user
    * If you need help on this, you can check it out [here]() **Adding later cause its not important**

## Things to keep in mind  

I structured these sections in the way of theory(as in the fundemental concepts behind why and how git does things), practical(as in the actual git commands used) and then the tutorials/walkthroughs(these are the links at the bottom of some of the practicals).

After finishing some of the sections in this part, there might be a practical section linked at the bottom.  
I would highly recommend doing them as they are probably the most important out of this whole guide.  

With that, you are all set on your journey of learning git.
### Its time to git gud.
