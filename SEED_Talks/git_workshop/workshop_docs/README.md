# Git Workshop

Welcome stranger, you are now on a git and github guide on this website.  

If you have stumbled here by accident, [here]() is the link to other SEED_Talks that you can check out.  
If you are here for the workshop, please continue reading, and I hope you will learn a thing or two.  

## Just abit about me

Hi, I am Lim Chuan Hao, a year 1 student at Singapore Polytechnic.  
The main reason for me making this guide was that I simply wanted an easier way to teach my friends how to learn git and github. 

Also I did not like the way I learnt git and github(which was mainly 5 hours of video and a lot of trial and error afterwards).  

Thus, I wanted a way where you can learn and try out the commands at the same time, which was the way I eventually picked up git and github and have been using ever since to do version control on all of my future projects.
