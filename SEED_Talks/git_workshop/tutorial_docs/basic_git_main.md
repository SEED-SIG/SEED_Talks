# Basic Git tutorials

Hello welcome to the main section of the git tutorials.  
This is this main page for the tutorials, please look at the sidebar or below to find the tutorial for the group of sections you are looking for.  

## Context behind most of the tutorial

In this tutorial, I will assume you have some knowledge of html and thus the scenario is that we are trying to build a front-end web page.  
Thus you will be seeing files like `a.html` and `b.css` for example, in the projects.  

Feel free to edit these documents in any text editor you wise(I mainly used VS Code), and try to keep to the instructions shown.  
But as you are doing these tutorials, do exercise some common sense and things like `commit ids` not matching or editing the file differently are perfectly fine.  
Also if you screw up too much, you can also back track to the inital folder state, or move on and start on the same state in the next tutorial.  

With that said, I hope you will be successful in the tutorials and in learning git as well.
