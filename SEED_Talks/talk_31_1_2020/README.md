# Intro to version control (just git gud) PSA: It's not that scary.

**Held on:** 31st January 2020 Friday, 6pm @ T2156 (SEED Room)  

**Description:**  

Ever changed code and realised it stopped working? Tired of naming your files 'v1.py', 'v2.py' and even submitted the wrong file because of these names? Most importantly, always wondered how people collaborate on code?  

Version control with git would solve all these problems!
